# VelCom

VelCom lets you progressively benchmark one or more projects and monitor or
compare the benchmark results. This makes it easier to notice performance
regressions or see how different branches compare. It also lets you visualize
how different metrics have developed over time.

Here are a few links to get started:
- [Installation](docs/install.md)
- [CLI readme](cli/README.md)
- [Benchmark repo specification](docs/bench_repo_specification.md)
- [Guide to contributing](docs/contributing.md)
