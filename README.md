# VelCom

VelCom lets you progressively benchmark one or more projects and monitor or
compare the benchmark results. This makes it easier to notice performance
regressions or see how different branches compare. It also lets you visualize
how different metrics have developed over time.

Here are a few links to get started:
- [Installation](docs/install.md)
- [CLI readme](cli/README.md)

See the wiki for information on the
[benchmark repo specification](https://github.com/IPDSnelting/velcom/wiki/Benchmark-Repo-Specification).

For more details on development, such as which branches are considered stable, see the
[workflow and conventions](https://github.com/IPDSnelting/velcom/wiki/Workflow-and-Conventions)
page.
