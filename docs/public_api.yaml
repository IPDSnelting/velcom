        This endpoint allows users to upload a tar file that the server should benchmark. The tar file is added to the queue with a relatively high priority.

        If the filename specified in the form-data body ends with `.tar.gz`, the tar file will be automatically uncompressed. If it doesn't it is treated as a normal, uncompressed tar file.

        The `dimensions` query parameter consists of multiple sections separated by double colons (`::`).
        Each section contains a benchmark name and a list of metric names, separated by a single colon (`:`).

        For example, to select the `time` and `lines` metrics for the `parser` benchmark, as well as the `time` metric for the `compile` benchmark, use this string as your `dimensions` query parameter:
        ```
        parser:time:lines::compile:time
        ```

        If some of the dimensions don't exist, they may be omitted from the response.

        In ambiguous situations, `start_time` defaults to the earliest commit's time and `end_time` defaults to the present time.
        If only `duration` is set, `end_time` takes precedence over `start_time`.
        `end_time` must be more recent than `start_time`.
        `start_time`, `end_time` and `duration` must not all be set, otherwise the request is rejected.

        The `repos` query parameter consists of multiple sections separated by double colons (`::`).
        Each section contains a repo id and a list of branch names, separated by a single colon (`:`).

        For example, to select the repo `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000` with branches `master` and `foo/bar`, as well as the repo `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff` with branches `master` and `develop`, use this string as your `repos` query parameter:
        ```
        123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000:master:foo/bar::00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff:master:develop
        ```

        See also `man git-check-ref-format`.

        The `dimension` query parameter has the format `benchmark:metric`.
        In contrast to the `dimensions` parameter of the `/graph/detail/{repoid}` endpoint, this parameter only allows exactly one benchmark and exactly one metric.

        For example, to select the `time` metric for the `parser` benchmark, use this string as your `dimension` query parameter:
        ```
        parser:time
        ```

        The `start_time`, `end_time` and `duration` parameters work the same as for the `/graph/detail/{repoid}` endpoint.
        If some of the repos don't exist, they may be omitted from the response.
